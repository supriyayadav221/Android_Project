 CSE 225 CA project
 P2: Create a THEME android app as follows (consider the word “theme” as “color” in the question):
(a) App contains activity having view pager, create two fragments & embed them on view pager
(b) On a fragment add ten radio buttons with different theme names to select a theme.
(c) On selecting a theme, apply the color on the background of the other fragment (swipe to see).
(d) On first start of application, default theme should be blue but on every subsequent start of application, the last selected theme should be there on the fragment. (may use file handling).

P4: Create an app to save contents on a custom edit text (multi line, having x to clear text on it) in a file (internal storage) on a button click. Use another custom button (having hover effect) to show a toast that display the file's contents.

P5: Create an app with multiple fragments separated horizontally, shown on an activity and implement code to transfer data from one fragment to another. Note: use effective example.
